Gemnote problem

Timing:
started: 305pm Thursday
first sample json written: 415pm
sample json done 440pm
reading about jsonb in postgres: 455pm
taking a break to do other stuff: 510pm

restarting: 300pm, Tuesday
researching nedb as an alternative to postgres for this challenge. Postgres is
probably preferable for production.
decision to keep postgres: 310pm
wrote and tested build_db in Makefile: 325pm




Requirements
- /products
  - GET returns a list of products
  - POST to create a new product

- /products/{product_id}
  - GET one product


Nice to have
- filter by category (separate db table)
  - /products?category={category_id}
- search by string
  - /products/search?q={string}
- caching. Probably elasticsearch?
- pagination
- versioning
  - use Accept header, not url

Potential DB implementations
- SQL
    - should use EAV model
    - easy to filter and parse data
    - data spread over many tables, fetching requires many joins.
    - more consistent
- NoSQL
    - scalable. Don't have column creep with more product types
    -

Current price tiers

50, 150, 300

50, 150, 300

Misc
- both patagonia jacket urls link to black
- repeat of 'glass' in Kinto description
- made up category ids

TODO
- add name to each variant
- sku could be replaced with uuid because we don't actually need to extract any product data from it
